Today I am releasing the `BottomSheet v4`, with a rewritten implementation to provide more stability, performance, and more features.

## Features

In this release, I have rewritten the implementation to 100% utilize `Reanimated v2` hooks and variables instead of using the JS once. This allows for more customization and provides more stability overall.

### Keyboard Handling

Keyboard handling was released with `v3`, however, there were some issues that pushed this release. Now the keyboard handling is enabled by default and provides more options to customize the behavior, a new prop `android_keyboardInputMode` is introduced to handle the `Android` keyboard appearance config `windowSoftInputMode`.

### Pull to Refresh

One of the earliest feature request that was submitted to repo [Pull to refresh](https://github.com/gorhom/react-native-bottom-sheet/issues/66) by [gudberg](https://github.com/gudberg). There was an attempt to implement it on `v3` & `v2` but I was hit with their limitations, until now.

This feature is enabled by default, users need to provide `refreshing` & `onRefresh` to any of the [Scrollables](/scrollables) and voila!

### Detach Sheet / Modal

  url={useBaseUrl("video/bottom-sheet-detach-preview.mp4")}
/>

Another powerful addition to `BottomSheet` & `BottomSheetModal` is the ability to detach the sheet from the bottom - so no more bottom sheet üòÖ -, which allows users to come up with lots of creative choices and customization to the sheet position.

### Footer Component

<Video

  url={useBaseUrl("video/bottom-sheet-footer-preview.mp4")}
/>

Lastly, I have added a new prop `footerComponent` to `BottomSheet` & `BottomSheetModal` to allow users to stick their custom component to the bottom of the sheet even when the keyboard is shown.
